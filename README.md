Macroinvertebrate Trends (EA) — Seasonal cNorm GAM Analysis

This project estimates national, population-level trends for four freshwater macroinvertebrate families using Environment Agency (EA) monitoring data. We align EA’s two recording modes—categorical AB classes and one-significant-figure numeric counts—and fit season-varying generalized additive models (GAMs). The censored-normal (cNorm) model on a variance-stabilizing 𝑝 power scale is our headline analysis; binomial presence/absence (PA), ordered categorical (OCAT), and censored Poisson (cPois) provide triangulation.

Target families: Aphelocheiridae, Brachycentridae, Odontoceridae, Cordulegastridae.
